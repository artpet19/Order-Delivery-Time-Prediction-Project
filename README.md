# Data-Science-Project
In this Project, i built a predictive model to predict Delivery Duration.


Purpose
When a consumer places an order on DoorDash, the expected time of delivery has to be shown, It is very important for DoorDash to get this right because it has a big impact on consumer experience.

For a given delivery l must predict the total delivery duration seconds , i.e., the time taken from
Start: the time consumer submits the order (created_at) to
End: when the order will be delivered to the consumer (actual_delivery_time)

Data Description
The csv dataset contains a subset of deliveries received at DoorDash in early 2015 in a subset of the cities. Each row in this file corresponds to one unique delivery and each column corresponds to a feature as explained below. 
Note all money (dollar) values given in the data are in cents and all time duration values given are in seconds

The target value to predict here is the total seconds value between created_at and actual_delivery_time.

Columns in the csv dataset
Time features
market_id: A city/region in which DoorDash operates, e.g., Los Angeles, given in the data as an id
created_at: Timestamp in UTC when the order was submitted by the consumer to DoorDash. (Note this timestamp is in UTC, but in case you need it, the actual timezone of the region was US/Pacific)
actual_delivery_time: Timestamp in UTC when the order was delivered to the consumer

Store features
store_id: an id representing the restaurant the order was submitted for
store_primary_category: cuisine category of the restaurant, e.g., italian, asian
order_protocol: a store can receive orders from DoorDash through many modes. This field represents an id denoting the protocol

Order features
total_items: total number of items in the order
subtotal: total value of the order submitted (in cents)
num_distinct_items: number of distinct items included in the order
min_item_price: price of the item with the least cost in the order (in cents)
max_item_price: price of the item with the highest cost in the order (in cents)

Market features
DoorDash being a marketplace, we have information on the state of marketplace when the order is placed, that can be used to estimate delivery time. The following features are values at the time of created_at (order submission time):

total_onshift_dashers: Number of available dashers who are within 10 miles of the store at the time of order creation
total_busy_dashers: Subset of above total_onshift_dashers who are currently working on an order
total_outstanding_orders: Number of orders within 10 miles of this order that are currently being processed.
Predictions from other models

estimated_order_place_duration: Estimated time for the restaurant to receive the order from DoorDash (in seconds)
estimated_store_to_consumer_driving_duration: Estimated travel time between store and consumer (in seconds)
Practicalities
Build a model to predict the total delivery duration seconds (as defined above). Feel free to generate additional features from the given data to improve model performance. 

Explain:
model(s) used,
how you evaluated your model performance on the historical data,

feature engineering choices you made,
other information you would like to share your modeling approach.
